# In scikit-learn coef_ attribute holds the vectors of the separating hyperplanes for linear models. It has shape (n_classes, n_features) if n_classes > 1 (multi-class one-vs-all) and (1, n_features) for binary classification.
#
# In this toy binary classification example, n_features == 2, hence w = coef_[0] is the vector orthogonal to the hyperplane (the hyperplane is fully defined by it + the intercept).
#
# To plot this hyperplane in the 2D case (any hyperplane of a 2D plane is a 1D line), we want to find a f as in y = f(x) = a.x + b. In this case a is the slope of the line and can be computed by a = -w[0] / w[1].
